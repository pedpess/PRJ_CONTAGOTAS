#Android Project Conta Gotas

This repo was created to apply some patterns of developing a project for Android from scratch to consolidate my knowledges of Java programmer and also to figure out new ways of developing an Android app. This is my first Android app and I worked together with @AndreFRSales, whose skills helped me to understand how to develop an Android app better.

##What I intend to learn:

- DAO
- How to handle with activities
- UX
- SQLite
